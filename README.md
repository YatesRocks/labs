# What is this?

My assignment monorepo. The increased productivity this gives me is pretty profound.
I'll be asking Prof. Wulf on monday if that's alright, if he says no I'll split it up.

## How to run

Super simple setup. If you're in IntelliJ, you should be able to
see the **run** task in the Gradle menu under **Application** group. 
Or if you're on the command line:

**Windows**: `gradlew.bat run`

**Linux**: `./gradlew run`
